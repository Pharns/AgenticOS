- # AgenticOS Activity Summary
- Period:** December 11-12, 2025
- Generated:** 2025-12-12
- Location:** AgenticOS Project Root
- ## Executive Summary
- Over the past 48 hours, AgenticOS underwent significant development and testing, with major enhancements to the agent execution framework, memory system integration, and diagnostic tooling. The project evolved from a basic agent router to a production-ready agentic workflow platform with comprehensive logging, memory persistence, and health monitoring.
- Key Metrics:
- Total agent executions:** 33 (all on Dec 12)
- New scripts created:** 2 (doctor, memory)
- Lines of code added to agent script:** ~34,000+ (11KB → 45KB)
- Configuration files updated:** 2 (agents.yaml, workflows.yaml)
- Memory files created:** 8
- Documentation updates:** Multiple
- Noting possible environment issues
- I'm flagging a potential read-only environment causing git warnings and plan to review config, docs, and STOPPING_POINT.md next to understand diagnostics context and pending tasks.
- # Stopping Point — 2025-12-22
- ## 1) Current status
- Claude provider fully operational** — research and grc profiles work end-to-end
- Gemini provider fully operational** — quick profile works end-to-end
- Codex provider fully operational** — dev and ops profiles work end-to-end
- Cursor-agent provider integrated** — refactor profile configured (currently rate-limited)
- ## 2) What is fully complete and verified
- Agent runner hardened: no `shell=True`, stdin-fed prompts, wrapper flags isolated from provider, SIGPIPE handled, run_id logged.
- Claude Code CLI integration**: Added `_is_claude()` helper and stdin passthrough in `build_command_argv()` for proper `--system-prompt` injection.
- Gemini CLI integration**: Added `_is_gemini()` helper; system prompt prepended to user query as positional argument.
- Cursor-agent CLI integration**: Added `_is_cursor_agent()` helper; system prompt prepended to user query as positional argument with `-p --output-format text`.
- Updated agents.yaml**: Claude profiles use `claude -p -`, Gemini uses `gemini`, Cursor-agent uses `cursor-agent`.
- Normalization/summary tightened to structured sections only; summary prints exactly three bullets.
- Repository inspected (not a git repo; read-only warnings). Key docs reviewed including STOPPING_POINT.md and recent logs.
- ✓ Inspect repository structure and version control status for anomalies or pending changes
- ✓ Review configuration/docs for diagnostics context and prior notes
- → Summarize current status and recommended remediation steps
- Summarizing environment and access issues
- The environment is read-only with no writable /tmp directory, preventing execution of commands requiring temp file creation or git operations; Python is unavailable due to an xcode stub. The repo is not recognized as a git repository, limiting modification tracking. Virtualization or network restrictions likely block normal diagnostic and code execution workflows. Next steps include ensuring a writable filesystem (especially /tmp), verifying or initializing a git repo, and confirming network settings to allow required operations once permissions permit.
- Diagnostics completed; summarizing environment constraints and next steps.
- ✓ Inspect repository structure and version control status for anomalies or pending changes
- ✓ Review configuration/docs for diagnostics context and prior notes
- ✓ Summarize current status and recommended remediation steps
- Diagnostics
- No git repository detected at the current path, so git commands fail; files exist but cannot run git operations.
- The environment is read-only, with `/tmp` unwritable causing errors and Python missing due to Xcode setup.
- Logs from `.agents/logs/2025-12-22T10-45-02Z-dev.json` and the STOPPING_POINT.md show the session was blocked by the read-only filesystem; all providers otherwise appear operational, except cursor actions are rate-limited.
- To resolve, ensure the filesystem is writable, particularly re-enabling `/tmp` for write access.
- Confirm Python is installed and accessible or set up an alternative, then rerun the doctor and workflow commands to verify fixes.
- Diagnostics
- Environment is read-only with no writable `/tmp`; commands that need temp files fail (e.g., `git status`, Python, heredocs) as seen in `.agents/logs/2025-12-22T10-45-02Z-dev.json`.
- Repo path `/Users/pharnsgenece/Nextcloud/.../AgenticOS` is not a git checkout (`git status` reports “not a git repository”).
- Workflow definition for `ops_check` remains intact with steps `diagnostics` → `review` (`.agents/workflows.yaml`).
- Remediation Steps
- 3) Once writable, run `./scripts/doctor --strict` and `./scripts/agent-workflow ops_check` to confirm health and capture fresh logs.

        Code changes
- ## 2025-12-12T23:28:55.163435+00:00Z
- Tags: session-summary, end-of-day, documentation, bug-fix
- Summary: Completed a full system review, fixed multiple bugs in agent and router scripts, and generated comprehensive technical documentation. The system is stable and all health checks pass.
- Artifacts:
- README.md
- docs/
- scripts/agent
- scripts/router
- notes/work-log.md
- Doctor strict passes end-to-end (40 OK, 0 WARN, 0 FAIL).
- Documentation updated with links to the 2025-12-12 technical update (README/USER_GUIDE).
- ## 3) What is known-broken and why
- Checking accessibility of .agents path
- agents.yaml
- agents.yaml.bak.1765556237
- logs
- memory
- prompts
- router_auto_rules.json
- schemas
- workflows.yaml
- Evaluating diagnostics under read-only constraints
- Running the diagnostic script might fail due to write restrictions in read-only mode, so it's safer to inspect configuration files directly for key info and provide summaries without executing potentially failing commands.

- Avoiding heredoc to run Python
- The environment is read-only and disallows creating temp files for heredocs, so switching to using `python -c` with inline commands avoids temporary files and should work for running Python snippets.

- Noting environment read-only and updating plan
- I confirmed the environment is read-only and lacks a Python runtime due to Xcode stubs, so no new memory can be created or git used. I’m updating step statuses based on this context.
- Diagnostics
- Environment is read-only with no writable `/tmp`; commands that need temp files fail (e.g., `git status`, Python, heredocs) as seen in `.agents/logs/2025-12-22T10-45-02Z-dev.json`.
- Repo path `/Users/pharnsgenece/Nextcloud/.../AgenticOS` is not a git checkout (`git status` reports “not a git repository”).
- Latest status note (`STOPPING_POINT.md`) says all profiles (Claude, Gemini, Codex) are operational; only Cursor-agent is rate-limited. Doctor strict previously passed 40/0/0.
- Workflow definition for `ops_check` remains intact with steps `diagnostics` → `review` (`.agents/workflows.yaml`).
- Remediation Steps
- 1) Switch to a writable environment or remount to restore `/tmp` and filesystem write access; then re-run diagnostics/tests.
- 2) Ensure Python (or another JSON viewer) is available to inspect log files without relying on Xcode stubs.
- 3) Once writable, run `./scripts/doctor --strict` and `./scripts/agent-workflow ops_check` to confirm health and capture fresh logs.
