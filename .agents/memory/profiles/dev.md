- # AgenticOS — Cross-Platform Agentic Workflow Template (Ubuntu + macOS)
- AgenticOS is a **portable, deterministic, auditable agent operating layer** you can drop into any project. It provides a structured, predictable way to run AI-assisted workflows safely in any environment.
- > **Note:** For the complete, authoritative documentation, please refer to **[[USER_GUIDE.md]]**. This README provides a high-level overview and quick-start guide.
---
- ## ✨ Core Features
- *   **Authoritative Entry Point:** `scripts/router` acts as the primary, recommended entry point that *decides* which action to take.
- *   **Controlled Execution:** `scripts/agent` is the underlying execution engine that *runs* a specific task, and is documented for advanced or intentional direct usage.
- *   **Declarative Definitions:** Agent profiles are defined in `.agents/agents.yaml` and multi-step sequences in `.agents/workflows.yaml`.
- *   **Structured Logging:** All actions are recorded in machine-readable JSON format under `.agents/logs/`.
- *   **Continuous Validation:** The `scripts/doctor` command ensures system health and enforces operational guarantees.
- *   **Persistent Memory & Deltas:** An optional system at `.agents/memory/` captures and tracks changes across sessions.

- # 99 - Roadmap (Non-Binding)
- The evolution of AgenticOS is guided by a commitment to expand its capabilities while maintaining its core principles of determinism, explainability, and auditability. The following roadmap outlines potential future phases, which are non-binding and subject to change based on evolving needs and priorities.
---
- ## 1. Future Phases
- Future phases may include:
- *   **Workflow chaining:** Enhancements to allow for more complex, interconnected workflows where the output of one workflow can seamlessly feed into the input of another, enabling multi-stage autonomous processes.
- *   **Replay and provenance:** Advanced features for replaying past agent sessions and providing a deeper understanding of the provenance of every decision and output, crucial for debugging, auditing, and compliance.
- *   **Policy enforcement layers:** The introduction of configurable policy layers that can govern agent behavior, resource access, and output content, providing an additional layer of control and safety in sensitive operations.
- These future capabilities will be designed to be opt-in and contract-driven, ensuring that users retain explicit control and transparency over their AgenticOS deployments.
- thinking
- **Requesting clarification on task**
- No specific code changes or tasks were found, so I'll ask the user to clarify what modifications or features they want implemented next.

- # AgenticOS Work Log
- ## 2025-12-11
- Added running work log for portfolio documentation.
- Fixed `scripts/agent-workflow` profile lookup to pull provider details from `profiles` map, ensuring workflow listings show accurate provider/command info.
- Added missing `ops` agent profile to `.agents/agents.yaml` to fix the `ops_check` workflow.
- Patched `scripts/agent` to prevent JSON serialization errors by explicitly decoding subprocess output streams.
- Corrected exception logging in `scripts/agent` to use `str(exc)` directly, fixing a `NameError` after `_text` function removal.
- Updated `agents.yaml` to include `--profile {profile}` in `codex exec` commands to fix `Exit Code: 2` errors.
- Modified `scripts/agent` to correctly log `workflow_name` and `workflow_step` from environment variables.
- Fixed `scripts/agent` argument parsing: Changed 'profile' from positional to named argument (`--profile`).
- Created AgenticOS documentation folder structure including `docs/logs` and top-level placeholder markdown files.
- Populated all AgenticOS documentation files (00-introduction.md to 99-roadmap.md) based on `USER_GUIDE.md` and script analysis.

- AgenticOS is a **portable, deterministic, auditable agent operating layer** you can drop into any project. It provides a structured, predictable way to run AI-assisted workflows safely in any environment.
- > **Note:** For the complete, authoritative documentation, please refer to **[[USER_GUIDE.md]]**. This README provides a high-level overview and quick-start guide.
---
- ## ✨ Core Features
- *   **Authoritative Entry Point:** `scripts/router` acts as the primary, recommended entry point that *decides* which action to take.
- *   **Controlled Execution:** `scripts/agent` is the underlying execution engine that *runs* a specific task, and is documented for advanced or intentional direct usage.
- *   **Declarative Definitions:** Agent profiles are defined in `.agents/agents.yaml` and multi-step sequences in `.agents/workflows.yaml`.
- *   **Structured Logging:** All actions are recorded in machine-readable JSON format under `.agents/logs/`.
- *   **Continuous Validation:** The `scripts/doctor` command ensures system health and enforces operational guarantees.
- *   **Persistent Memory & Deltas:** An optional system at `.agents/memory/` captures and tracks changes across sessions.

- # 99 - Roadmap (Non-Binding)
- The evolution of AgenticOS is guided by a commitment to expand its capabilities while maintaining its core principles of determinism, explainability, and auditability. The following roadmap outlines potential future phases, which are non-binding and subject to change based on evolving needs and priorities.
---
- ## 1. Future Phases
- Future phases may include:
- *   **Workflow chaining:** Enhancements to allow for more complex, interconnected workflows where the output of one workflow can seamlessly feed into the input of another, enabling multi-stage autonomous processes.
- *   **Replay and provenance:** Advanced features for replaying past agent sessions and providing a deeper understanding of the provenance of every decision and output, crucial for debugging, auditing, and compliance.
- *   **Policy enforcement layers:** The introduction of configurable policy layers that can govern agent behavior, resource access, and output content, providing an additional layer of control and safety in sensitive operations.
- These future capabilities will be designed to be opt-in and contract-driven, ensuring that users retain explicit control and transparency over their AgenticOS deployments.
- thinking
- **Checking for update requests**
- I'm checking notes, agent configs, scripts, and documentation for any implicit or explicit user requests or update instructions before proceeding.

- # AgenticOS Work Log
- ## 2025-12-11
- Added running work log for portfolio documentation.
- Fixed `scripts/agent-workflow` profile lookup to pull provider details from `profiles` map, ensuring workflow listings show accurate provider/command info.
- Added missing `ops` agent profile to `.agents/agents.yaml` to fix the `ops_check` workflow.
- Patched `scripts/agent` to prevent JSON serialization errors by explicitly decoding subprocess output streams.
- Corrected exception logging in `scripts/agent` to use `str(exc)` directly, fixing a `NameError` after `_text` function removal.
- Updated `agents.yaml` to include `--profile {profile}` in `codex exec` commands to fix `Exit Code: 2` errors.
- Modified `scripts/agent` to correctly log `workflow_name` and `workflow_step` from environment variables.
- Fixed `scripts/agent` argument parsing: Changed 'profile' from positional to named argument (`--profile`).
- Created AgenticOS documentation folder structure including `docs/logs` and top-level placeholder markdown files.
- Populated all AgenticOS documentation files (00-introduction.md to 99-roadmap.md) based on `USER_GUIDE.md` and script analysis.

        Code changes

- Doctor strict passes end-to-end (40 OK, 0 WARN, 0 FAIL).
- Documentation updated with links to the 2025-12-12 technical update (README/USER_GUIDE).
- ## 3) What is known-broken and why
- Noting read-only block on changes
- The repository is mounted read-only, so I can't implement or verify code changes without write access or specific requested updates. The plan highlights the need to confirm requirements and obtain write permission before proceeding.
- None; workspace is read-only, so I couldn’t modify files. Please grant write access or provide an editable environment.

        Verification
- Not run; will execute the relevant `./scripts/...` commands after changes are made once write access is available.
- Confirming read-only constraints and next steps
- I’m verifying that code modifications aren’t possible in this environment and will clarify this while still providing structured responses including plan and verification. Next, I’ll check for any existing instructions or files like STOPPING_POINT to understand possible user intents or tasks.
- # Stopping Point — 2025-12-22
- ## 1) Current status
- Claude provider fully operational** — research and grc profiles work end-to-end
- Gemini provider fully operational** — quick profile works end-to-end
- Codex provider fully operational** — dev and ops profiles work end-to-end
- Cursor-agent provider integrated** — refactor profile configured (currently rate-limited)
- ## 2) What is fully complete and verified
- Agent runner hardened: no `shell=True`, stdin-fed prompts, wrapper flags isolated from provider, SIGPIPE handled, run_id logged.
- Claude Code CLI integration**: Added `_is_claude()` helper and stdin passthrough in `build_command_argv()` for proper `--system-prompt` injection.
- Gemini CLI integration**: Added `_is_gemini()` helper; system prompt prepended to user query as positional argument.
- Cursor-agent CLI integration**: Added `_is_cursor_agent()` helper; system prompt prepended to user query as positional argument with `-p --output-format text`.
- Updated agents.yaml**: Claude profiles use `claude -p -`, Gemini uses `gemini`, Cursor-agent uses `cursor-agent`.
- Normalization/summary tightened to structured sections only; summary prints exactly three bullets.
- Not run; will execute the relevant `./scripts/...` commands after changes are made once write access is available.
