# 99 - Roadmap (Non-Binding)

The evolution of AgenticOS is guided by a commitment to expand its capabilities while maintaining its core principles of determinism, explainability, and auditability. The following roadmap outlines potential future phases, which are non-binding and subject to change based on evolving needs and priorities.

## 1. Future Phases

Future phases may include:

*   **Workflow chaining:** Enhancements to allow for more complex, interconnected workflows where the output of one workflow can seamlessly feed into the input of another, enabling multi-stage autonomous processes.
*   **Replay and provenance:** Advanced features for replaying past agent sessions and providing a deeper understanding of the provenance of every decision and output, crucial for debugging, auditing, and compliance.
*   **Policy enforcement layers:** The introduction of configurable policy layers that can govern agent behavior, resource access, and output content, providing an additional layer of control and safety in sensitive operations.

These future capabilities will be designed to be opt-in and contract-driven, ensuring that users retain explicit control and transparency over their AgenticOS deployments.
